# Electricity Demand & Weather Analysis – Nordic Cities

This repository contains a data pipeline and exploratory analysis of electricity demand, pricing, and weather patterns across three major Nordic cities: **Stockholm**, **Oslo**, and **Copenhagen**. The goal is to prepare high-quality datasets and uncover preliminary insights to support future forecasting models.

---

## Project Overview

This project integrates three key data sources:
- **Electricity Demand (Actual Load)** from [ENTSO-E](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/)
- **Day-Ahead Market Prices** from the same ENTSO-E source
- **Weather Observations** from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

All data has been fetched, validated, merged, and enriched with time-based features for analysis. The current stage concludes the initial preprocessing and exploratory data analysis phase.

## Setup & Requirements

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.10+
- [Prefect 2.x](https://docs.prefect.io/)
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, requests, dotenv

**Environment:**
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:
ENTSOE_TOKEN=your_entsoe_api_key
OWM_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key


---

## Data Collection & Ingestion

Data collection is automated using Prefect flows:

- **Electricity Demand (`entsoe_prefect.py`)**  
  Fetches 60 days of historical load data from ENTSO-E per city.

- **Electricity Price (`entsoe_price_flow`)**  
  Retrieves hourly day-ahead market prices for each city.

- **Weather Data (`weather_current_flow`)**  
  Collects daily weather metrics (temperature, humidity, etc.) from OpenWeatherMap.

The collected data is saved in CSV format under `data/entsoe/` and `data/weather/`.

---

## Preprocessing & Validation

Preprocessing included the following steps:

1. **Timezone Standardization**  
   All timestamps were normalized to UTC and made timezone-naive to ensure alignment between sources.

2. **Data Merging**  
   - Load and price data were merged by timestamp.
   - Weather data was matched by date using city-specific coordinates.
   - Final merged datasets saved under `data/processed/`.

3. **Validation Tasks**
   - Confirmed datetime continuity (daily granularity).
   - Verified expected data types (`float64` for all numerical fields).
   - Checked for and handled missing values.
   - Detected outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) method.
   - Confirmed no duplicate timestamps.

4. **Resampling**  
   Hourly data was resampled to daily averages where needed to match weather data resolution.

## Feature Engineering

New time-based features were added to enhance modeling:

- `day_of_week`, `month`, `is_weekend`  
  These help capture seasonal and behavioral electricity usage patterns.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory steps and insights included:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   Summary of key variables: load, price, temperature, and humidity.

2. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Oslo: Strong negative correlation between temperature and load (–0.72)
   - Stockholm: Moderate negative temp-load correlation (–0.57)
   - Copenhagen: Weak correlation (–0.16)
   - Load vs Price showed weak to moderate positive correlation in all cities

3. **Linear Fit Models**
   - Estimated the slope of load vs temperature:
     - Oslo: –75 MW/°C
     - Stockholm: –115 MW/°C
     - Copenhagen: –12 MW/°C

4. **Scatter Plots**
   - Load vs Temperature
   - Price vs Load (colored by temperature)

5. **Histograms**
   - Load distribution per city (to detect skew, peaks)
   - Price distribution (to detect volatility, spikes)

6. **Weekday Profiles**
   - Load compared across days of the week
   - Lower demand observed on weekends, consistent with industrial slowdown

## Modeling and Forecasting Progress

### Feature Engineering

Feature engineering was conducted across all three cities (Oslo, Stockholm, Copenhagen), producing well-structured datasets of 51 rows and 22 columns each. This included:

- **Lag features**: capturing prior day/week demand and price patterns (`demand_lag1`, `price_lag7`, etc.)
- **Rolling averages**: smoothing over 7-day windows for demand, price, and temperature
- **Differencing features**: highlighting short- and long-term changes (`demand_diff1`, `price_diff7`)
- **Forecast targets**: created as `demand_next` and `price_next` (T+1 horizon)

The resulting features captured both temporal dynamics and recent trends, forming a solid foundation for predictive modeling.

---

### Baseline Modeling

Initial models using **XGBoost** were trained per city on `demand_next` and `price_next` targets. Training on the first 47 days and testing on the last 4 showed perfectly fitted models on training data (MAE and RMSE near zero), highlighting potential overfitting. These models were later used for comparative and ensemble purposes.

---

### Diagnostics & Data Profiling

Each city’s dataset underwent diagnostic checks including label integrity, distribution analysis, outlier detection, and feature importance estimation.

- **All datasets had complete labels** (`demand_next`, `price_next`)
- **Demand variation**:
  - Oslo: Avg ≈ 3171 MW, std ≈ 262
  - Stockholm: Avg ≈ 8380 MW, std ≈ 601
  - Copenhagen: Avg ≈ 2454 MW, std ≈ 173
- **Price variation**:
  - Ranged from 9 to 113 across cities, with high standard deviations indicating volatility
- **Outlier detection**:
  - Roughly 5 outliers detected per city (≈10%)
- **Key features for demand prediction**:
  - Oslo: `temp_C`, `price_roll7`, `demand_diff1`
  - Stockholm: `temp_C`, `temp_roll7`, `price_roll7`
  - Copenhagen: `demand_diff1`, `cloudcover`, `windspeed`

### Ensemble Modeling (Ridge + RF + XGBoost)

To address overfitting and model generalization, a 3-model ensemble was implemented using weights:

- Ridge: 0.2  
- Random Forest: 0.3  
- XGBoost: 0.5

Performance was evaluated using **5-fold cross-validation**:

#### Demand Forecasting Highlights:

- **Oslo**:
  - Ensemble MAE ≈ 154, RMSE ≈ 198
  - Ensemble outperformed Ridge and XGBoost individually
  - Substantial gain over dummy baseline (MAE ≈ 192)

- **Stockholm**:
  - Ensemble MAE ≈ 421, RMSE ≈ 512
  - Strong improvement over dummy (MAE ≈ 565)

- **Copenhagen**:
  - Ensemble MAE ≈ 122, RMSE ≈ 156
  - Outperformed all single models and baseline (MAE ≈ 151)

#### Price Forecasting Highlights:

- **Oslo**:
  - Ensemble MAE ≈ 10.5, RMSE ≈ 14
  - Slightly better than baseline (MAE ≈ 10.4)

- **Stockholm**:
  - Ensemble MAE ≈ 12.3, RMSE ≈ 18.6
  - Significant gain over baseline (MAE ≈ 16.1)

- **Copenhagen**:
  - Ensemble MAE ≈ 17.4, RMSE ≈ 22.8
  - Close to baseline, but lower RMSE, indicating better control over outliers

---

### Evaluation vs Naive Baseline

All models were benchmarked against a naive "last known value" predictor:

- **Demand**:
  - Ensemble MAE reduced by over **80%** compared to naive in all cities (e.g., Stockholm: 646 → 92)
  - Random Forest also performed well, though ensemble had the best RMSE in every case

- **Price**:
  - Smaller margin over naive models due to the inherently noisier nature of pricing data
  - Still, ensemble RMSE was consistently lower than naive in all cases

These comparisons confirmed that the models captured meaningful patterns beyond simple heuristics.

---

### Forecasting Implementation

A multi-day forecasting function was developed using the ensemble models:

- Predicts `n_days` into the future (default = 7)
- Forecasts are saved as CSVs for each city (`forecast_{city}.csv`)
- Forecasting loop intelligently updates lag/rolling features using previously predicted values

Forecasts were generated and saved successfully for all three cities.

---

### Forecast Horizon Testing

Additional testing validated flexible forecasting horizons:

- **3-day forecast**: Produced plausible short-term predictions
- **14-day forecast**: Worked without failure, indicating stability and proper temporal chaining
- Confidence in extrapolation was cautiously affirmed, with awareness that uncertainty increases over longer horizons

---

### Forecast Visualization

Forecast vs actual plots were created to visually assess continuity and model realism:

- **Oslo**: Predicted demand gently extended recent rising trend. Price fluctuated realistically with no sharp breaks.
- **Stockholm**: Demand slightly flattened post-peak, while prices showed consistent upward movement.
- **Copenhagen**: Demonstrated the most balanced forecast — ensemble closely tracked observed dynamics for both demand and price.

These plots confirmed **logical progression** from recent data, showing that the model learns and generalizes temporal patterns smoothly.
